Homer3 codebase needed forked from Homer3 v1.80.2. Scripts have been modified if necessary. Will try to keep compatibility with Homer3.

Note: code modifications only affect performance and debuging, in essence any original Homer3 function (v1.80.2) should be interchangeable with them. New or incompatibly modified homer3 functions are put in `CustomFunctions` folder.
